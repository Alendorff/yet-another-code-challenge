Inradius problems for applicants
================================

Dear applicant,

every file and folder is a problem for you to solve.

If you are a frontend- or fullstack-developer, the css-problem is mandatory.

You can simply write your solution into the files. If you use TDD, please also check-in your (green) testfiles. Use any framework you think is needed.
