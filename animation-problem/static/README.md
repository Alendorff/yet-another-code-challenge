# Annoying Bug

This is a checkout from one of our projects (before the bugfix), with some small adjustments.

# Problem:

When the user moves the phone into landscape and then back into portrait mode on older phones (e.g. htc one) the animation stops working, sometimes it just stutters, sometimes it just isn't there.
